  "summary": "Most of the requested MediaAI UI is implemented: app shell with collapsible sidebar + 3 tabs, Image Maker with gallery and editor overlay components, Video Studio presentational screen, Voice Over script UI, and local AI stubs with dark theme styling. However, some requirements are either not met or not verifiable from the truncated diff, and a few extra features were added that were not requested.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Top header title changes based on the active tab using the exact user-facing labels shown in the provided snippet (Image Maker, Video Studio, Voice Over).",
      "reason": "The header titles implemented do change by tab, but they are different strings ('AI Image Creation & Editing', 'Video Slideshow Builder', 'AI Voice Synthesizer') rather than the tab labels specified in the requirement.",

      "requirement": "Show a loading indicator on Create actions when loading=true (as in the snippet).",
      "reason": "ImageMakerView is truncated in the diff at the Create button; the Create button’s loading-state rendering (spinner/text) is not visible, so this AC is not verifiable from the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Clicking an image opens the full-screen preview/editor and sets it as the selected image.",
      "reason": "The gallery component calls onImageSelect, and the overlay component exists, but ImageMakerView is truncated, so the actual wiring/rendering of the full-screen overlay when selectedImage is set is not fully visible/confirmable from the diff summary.",
